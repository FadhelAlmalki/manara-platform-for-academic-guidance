After graduating from high school, many students face confusion when it comes to choosing the right academic path. This uncertainty stems from a lack of knowledge and experience in understanding different academic disciplines, emerging fields, and career opportunities. Students need reliable and expert guidance to help them navigate their way toward selecting the most suitable major and university based on market demands, future career prospects, and their own skills.

In today's rapidly evolving academic landscape, selecting the right major and university is crucial as it significantly impacts students' future careers. Manara Platform is designed to be one of the key tools that guide students toward an academic path tailored to their strengths and aligned with industry needs.

In Saudi Arabia, there are limited specialized advising tools available to help students make informed decisions about their academic futures. A comprehensive tool is needed to assist students in choosing the right college and university by considering various factors such as their skills, market trends, aspirations, and future opportunities. At the same time, universities require a platform where they can present detailed information about their college and analyze students' skills to match them with potential academic programs.
Currently, students must visit numerous university websites and educational forums to gather insights into different college, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming. A centralized, specialized platform would streamline this process and provide students with a clearer path toward their future.

1. Academic College Page: Provide detailed information about different types of colleges available including required skills, and career opportunities post-graduation.
2. Saudi Universities Page: Offer a comprehensive list of universities in Saudi Arabia, including links to their respective websites.
3. Academic Advisors Page: Enable students to communicate with academic advisors who can answer their questions and offer guidance.
4. Add College Page: Allow students to submit new college that are not currently listed on the platform via a submission form.
5. Advisor Registration Page: Academic advisors can register through submission form voluntarily, offering their expertise and advice to students in the platform.
